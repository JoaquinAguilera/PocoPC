# PocoPC
Poco-Engine is a WIP lightweight scriptable engine/Pico-8 emulator written in C++ targeting both PC and the Nintendo Switch.
I experimented with using namespaces instead of classes for encapsulation in a few places, this was mostly to try out something new but I think it worked well given the nature and scope of the project.



This PC only repository is stripped of any Switch code or functionality as it is under NDA.
